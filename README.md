### [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in python

things I learned:

 - You can get going in python really fast.
 - No boilerplate of imports on stdlib needed i.e. [open](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open), [map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map)
