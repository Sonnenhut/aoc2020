### [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in python

things I learned:

 - You can get going in python really fast.
 - No boilerplate of imports on stdlib needed i.e. [open](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open), [map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map)
 - Most of the time code readability > performance (it can be X times more performant, but who would still understand the code?)
 - Out of the box memoization with [@functools.cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cache) (when arguments are hashable) 
 - itertools has some nice functions like [combinations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations)
